# rock-paper-scissors
-Understanding The Problem
Write a program that will play a round of the game of 'rock paper
scissors' against the computer, meaning that it will  take a user's
input and randomly return
either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. If the computer wins, print a "you
Lose!" message, and if the user wins, will print a "You've Won!"
message.

-plan 
The program will have an interface- a pop-up from the browser asking
from the user to choose and write either rock, paper, or scissors. The
The desired output is the choice of the computer and a message for
either winning or losing the game.  

-The algorithm in pseudocode for this problem:
//prompt a pop-up box with a message for the user, and ask for his choice
//when a user inputs his answer,  a function will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.
//a function will take the user's and the computers choices, evaluate
who is the winner and return
a string that declares the winner of the round.
